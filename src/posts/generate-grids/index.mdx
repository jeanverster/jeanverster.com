  I’m sure we’ve all been there before, you’re building out a screen
  and you find yourself writing out the same code over and over again
  to make a grid — Row, Column, Column, Row, Column, Column… You get
  the idea.
</p>
<br />
<p>But what if you could use CSS Grid to make your life easier?</p>
<br />

```tsx
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  Flex,
  Heading,
  useDisclosure,
} from "@chakra-ui/react";
import * as React from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { RiArrowUpDownLine } from "react-icons/ri";

const GridGeneratorDemo = (): JSX.Element => {
  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure();

  return (
    <Flex p={5} flexDir="column" justify="center">
      <Heading>Hey! I&apos;m some mdx</Heading>
      <motion.div animate={{ rotate: isOpen ? 90 : 0 }}>
        <Box shadow="lg" m={4} rounded="large" bg="blue.500">
          <Box as={RiArrowUpDownLine} size="48px" color="white" />
        </Box>
      </motion.div>
      <Button onClick={onToggle}>Click Me</Button>
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default GridGeneratorDemo;
```
