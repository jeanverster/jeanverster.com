Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all been there before, youâ€™re building out a screen
and you find yourself writing out the same code over and over again
to make a grid â€” Row, Column, Column, Row, Column, Columnâ€¦ You get
the idea.

But what if you could use CSS Grid to make your life easier?

<br />
import GridGeneratorDemo from "./components/GridGeneratorDemo";

<GridGeneratorDemo />
<br />

If youâ€™re like me then youâ€™ve probably figured there has to be a
cleaner & less pain staking way to create these grids. Turns out,
there is! Now this is not necessarily a new technique, it has been
around for quite a while. Using vanilla JS and html you were able to
write a loop which generated an html string, inserting a at every
nth interval to close and then reopen the html tag, then rendering
said string as html.

In React, however, this approach wouldnâ€™t work as you arenâ€™t able to
render JSX as a string. I had initially scratched my head a bit on
how you would go about achieving this, I felt that the most
intuitive way to use such a component would be to simply pass the
content you want to render as children and then our component would
handle all the grid generation stuff. Lucky for us React has some
handy methods for dealing with and manipulating child components!

For the sake of this tutorial, Iâ€™m using the react-flexbox-grid
package, but feel free to use any grid system you prefer â€” the logic
remains the same.

With that said, letâ€™s have a look at the code:

```tsx
import { chunk } from "lodash";
import * as React from "react";
import { Col, Row, Grid } from "react-flexbox-grid";

type GridGeneratorProps = {
  cols: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 12;
};

const GridGenerator = ({ cols, children }: GridGeneratorProps) => {
  const colWidth = 12 / cols;
  const rows = chunk(React.Children.toArray(children), cols);
  return (
    <Grid>
      {rows.map((cols) => (
        <Row>
          {cols.map((col) => (
            <Col sm={12} md={colWidth}>
              {col}
            </Col>
          ))}
        </Row>
      ))}
    </Grid>
  );
};

export default GridGenerator;
```

<br />
Letâ€™s break down whatâ€™s happening here:

Our component accepts a cols prop which needs to be a factor of 12
(to match the Bootstrap grid structure) â€” as the name suggests this
will determine the number of columns we want in our grid. The
colWidth variable is what weâ€™ll use for the Bootstrap class.

To create the rows we make use of the React.Children.toArray method,
this allows us to convert the children into an array that we can
then manipulate.

Usage is simple, just pass all the content you want rendered as
children to our GridGenerator component:

```tsx
<GridGenerator cols={3}>
  <Field
    name="firstName"
    label="First Name"
    component={ConnectedDatePicker}
  />
  <Field
    name="lastName"
    label="Last Name"
    component={ConnectedFormGroup}
  />
  <Field
    name="email"
    type="email"
    label="Email"
    component={ConnectedFormGroup}
  />
  <Field
    name="phoneNumber"
    label="Phone Number"
    component={ConnectedFormGroup}
  />
</GridGenerator>
```

<br />
Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re all set to generate dynamic grids using your handy new
`GridGenerator` component ðŸ™Œ
